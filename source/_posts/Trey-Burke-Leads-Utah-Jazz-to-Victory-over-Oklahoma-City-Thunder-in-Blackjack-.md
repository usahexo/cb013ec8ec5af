#  Trey Burke Leads Utah Jazz to Victory over Oklahoma City Thunder in Blackjack 

In a game that came down to the wire, Utah Jazz guard Trey Burke proved why he is one of the best young players in the league, scoring 30 points and leading his team to a 114-106 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Thunder got off to a fast start, taking an early lead and holding it until late in the second quarter. But the Jazz kept fighting, and took a 66-64 lead into halftime.

The third quarter was back and forth, with no team able to take more than a five-point lead. But with just over two minutes remaining in the quarter, Burke hit a 3-pointer to give the Jazz a 97-89 lead.

The Thunder made a late push in the fourth quarter, but couldn’t overcome the Jazz’s lead. Burke was helped by big performances from fellow starters Gordon Hayward (26 points) and Derrick Favors (15 points, 10 rebounds), as well as reserve forward Joe Ingles (14 points).

For the Thunder, Russell Westbrook led all scorers with 34 points, while Steven Adams added 14 points and 14 rebounds.

This was just the latest impressive win for Trey Burke and the Utah Jazz. With this victory, they improve to 21-19 on the season and move into seventh place in the Western Conference. The Jazz will look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 15th.

#  DeMarcus Cousins Dominates Memphis Grizzlies for Second Straight Win 

In his second game against the Memphis Grizzlies this season, DeMarcus Cousins was a force to be reckoned with. He finished the night with 29 points and 18 rebounds, leading the Kings to their second straight win.

Cousins was dominant in the paint, scoring on a variety of shots close to the basket. He was also aggressive on the defensive end, grabbing rebounds and blocking shots.

This is the kind of performance that Sacramento needs from Cousins if they want to make a playoff run this season. He has been playing some of his best basketball of the year in recent weeks, and if he can continue to dominate opponents like he did against Memphis, the Kings will be a tough team to beat.

#  Washington Wizards Come Back to Defeat Detroit Pistons in Blackjack 

The Washington Wizards entered the game against the Detroit Pistons as underdogs. The Pistons were coming into the game with a record of 6-2 and had just beaten the Golden State Warriors. The Wizards were looking to rebound after losing to the Philadelphia 76ers.

The game started slow for both teams, but it was the Wizards who came out on top. They managed to build a lead late in the first quarter and took a 27-19 advantage into the second.

The Pistons woke up in the second quarter and went on an 11-0 run to take a 30-29 lead. However, that would be their only lead of the night. The Wizards ended the half on another run to take a 59-49 lead into halftime.

Washington continued to extend their lead in the third quarter and led by as many as 22 points before taking an 83-61 advantage into the fourth quarter.

Detroit made a run at Washington in the fourth quarter, but it was too little too late. The Wizards held on to win 92-82 and improve their record to 5-3.

#  Giannis Antetokounmpo Leads Milwaukee Bucks Over Toronto Raptors 

The Toronto Raptors were the top seed in the Eastern Conference, but they were no match for the Giannis Antetokounmpo-led Milwaukee Bucks, who won four games to two in their first-round playoff series.

Antetokounmpo averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 blocks per game in the series, shooting 52.5 percent from the field. He was the unquestioned leader of the Bucks team, and his play was a big reason why they were able to advance to the next round.

Kawhi Leonard led the Raptors with averages of 31.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.8 steals per game, but he was unable to carry Toronto to victory against Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.

Toronto's other stars - Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, Serge Ibaka - all had disappointing performances in the series, which ultimately cost them a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals.

The Bucks will now face off against the Boston Celtics in the next round of the playoffs. The Celtics are a formidable opponent, but if Antetokounmpo can continue playing at this high level, Milwaukee has a chance of winning the series and advancing to the NBA Finals.

#  Anthony Davis Leads New Orleans Pelicans Over Houston Rockets

Anthony Davis led the New Orleans Pelicans to a 111-104 victory over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. Davis had 38 points and 16 rebounds in the win. Jrue Holiday added 20 points for the Pelicans, while Rajon Rondo finished with 11 assists. Eric Gordon led Houston with 24 points, while Chris Paul added 22 points and 11 assists.

Houston jumped out to an early lead in the game, but New Orleans was able to fight back and take the lead in the second quarter. The Pelicans would never relinquish the lead from there on out and pulled away late in the game.

Davis was unstoppable for New Orleans, scoring at will throughout the game. He was especially deadly in the third quarter, when he piled up 18 points. That helped propel New Orleans to a 91-81 lead heading into the fourth quarter.

Houston made a valiant effort to come back in the fourth, but Davis and Holiday were too much for them to handle. The Rockets got as close as 107-104, but New Orleans scored the final four points of the game to secure the victory.

The win improves New Orleans' record to 28-26 on the season and moves them into sixth place in the Western Conference standings. They remain two games behind Oklahoma City for fifth place, but now have a two-game cushion over ninth-place Memphis.

Houston falls to 39-17 on the season and remains in first place in the Western Conference standings. They still have a three-game lead over Golden State for first place overall.
