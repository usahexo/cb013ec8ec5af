#  Huge Gamble Pays Off for Flaubert!

This week, the Flaubert Corporation announced its plans to make a huge gamble on the future of the company. The Board of Directors has unanimously voted to approve a new investment strategy that will see the company pour all its resources into a single project.

"We're taking a calculated risk with our future," said CEO Claudia Flaubert in a statement to shareholders. "But we believe this investment will pay off big time."

The company has already begun production of the device, and it's scheduled to launch in early 2019. Pre-orders are already being taken, and initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

#  12,000 Bucks Win on 00 Roulette!

Casinos always try to make sure that the odds are in their favor. That's why you'll never find a game of pure chance like roulette at a casino. The house edge on almost all roulette games is around 2.7 percent, which means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep $2.70 on average.

However, there are ways to reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning. One such way is by betting on black or red instead of odd or even numbers. This cuts the house edge in half to 1.35 percent.

There is another strategy that can be even more effective: betting on a particular number. The house edge for this strategy is just 2.63 percent, making it one of the best bets you can make in a casino.

But how do you know which number to bet on? One popular method is to wait for the ball to settle on a particular number and then bet on the opposite color. For instance, if the ball settles on black, you would bet on red. This system has a house edge of just 1.35 percent and it's known as the D'Alembert system .

Another popular method is called the Martingale system . With this system, you double your bet after each loss until you win. This system also has a house edge of 1.35 percent.

While these systems work well, they require you to have a large bankroll so that you can continue doubling your bets when you lose. And even with a large bankroll, there's no guarantee that you will win in the long run .

So how can you increase your chances of winning while playing roulette? By using a proven strategy like the ones mentioned above, and by avoiding games with high house edges like American roulette .

#  What a Payout! Flaubert Cleans Up at Roulette Table

It's unclear whether or not Flaubert will continue his winning streak tonight, but one thing's for sure: he's going home with a lot more cash than he arrived with!
