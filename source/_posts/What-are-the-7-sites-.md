#  What are the 7 sites? 

The history of the world is full of mysteries, some that have been solved and others that remain unsolved to this day. One such mystery is what are the 7 sites? 

No one knows for sure who or what came up with the number seven, but it has been used throughout history in a variety of ways. It is said that there are seven wonders of the ancient world, seven deadly sins, seven virtues, and even seven days of the week. Many believe that the number seven is somehow magical or divine. 

One theory about the origin of the seven sites is that it refers to the seven main energy vortexes on planet Earth. These vortexes are said to be places where energy from Mother Earth and the universe are at their strongest. They are said to be powerful connectors to the spiritual realm and can be used for healing and manifesting desires. 

There are many people who believe in the power of these sites and have traveled all over the world to visit them. Here are some of them: 

1. Machu Picchu, Peru – This site is considered by many to be one of the most spiritual places on Earth. It is located high in the Andes Mountains and is believed to have been a sacred Inca pilgrimage site. 
2. Glastonbury Tor, England – This site is said to be one of the most important spiritual centers in Europe and is home to many legends and myths. It is also said to be one of the most powerful vortexes in the world. 
3. Mount Shasta, California – Mount Shasta is considered a place of power by many indigenous cultures as well as New Age followers. It is said to be a gateway into other dimensions and home to many spirits and light beings. 
4. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Australia – This park contains two massive rock formations called Uluru (or Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (or The Olgas). Both formations are considered sacred by indigenous Australians and are thought to be connected with spiritual energy vortexes. 
5. Stonehenge, England – Stonehenge is perhaps one of the most famous ancient sites in the world. It’s unclear exactly what it was used for, but many believe it was connected with spirituality or even magic. 
6. Easter Island, Chile – Easter Island is famous for its massive stone heads called Moai which were carved by the Rapa Nui people over a thousand years ago. The island itself is considered a place of great spiritual power and mana by locals and travelers alike. 
7. Cuzco, Peru – Cuzco was once the capital city of the Inca Empire and is still considered an important spiritual center in South America today. Numerous temples and churches can be found here as well as sacred sites like Sacsayhuaman fortress

#  What kind of photos can be shared? 

Photos are a great way to capture memories and moments with friends and family. They can also be used for business purposes, such as advertising or showcasing products. However, not all photos are appropriate for sharing online. 

There are some types of photos that should not be shared online, such as nudity or questionable content. Photos that could potentially cause someone harm or embarrassment should also be avoided. 

It is important to remember that once a photo is posted online, it is out there forever and can be viewed by anyone. Therefore, it is important to be selective about which photos are shared. Consider the audience that will be viewing the photo and whether it is appropriate for them. 

When in doubt, it is best to err on the side of caution and not post the photo. There are many other ways to share memories and moments without putting them online where they could potentially be seen by the wrong person.

#  Is there a limit to how many photos can be shared? 

For a long time, the answer to this question was a definitive “no.” However, in recent months, it seems that there may be a limit to how many photos can be shared on certain platforms. 

In November of 2018, Instagram announced that they were testing a new feature that would limit users to only sharing 10 photos per day. This announcement was met with mixed reactions from users, with some welcoming the change and others feeling that it was too restrictive. 

A few weeks later, Facebook announced that they were also testing a similar feature on their platform. This announcement was met with even more backlash than Instagram’s, with users arguing that Facebook is already too restrictive when it comes to how much content you can share. 

At the moment, it’s unclear if either of these changes will be implemented permanently or if they are simply tests. However, it seems that we may be reaching a point where social media platforms are starting to place limits on how much content we can share.

#  How many people can access the photos simultaneously? 

Can everyone see your picture if you post it online? The answer to this question used to be a clear yes, but with the increasing popularity of social media, that is not always the case. Different sites have different policies on how many people can access a photo at the same time. For example, on Facebook, any number of people can see a photo that you have posted, as long as they are friends with you. However, on Instagram, only up to 10 people can view a post at the same time. This is likely due to Instagram’s focus on being a photo-sharing site.

#  What if I don't want to share my photos online?

With digital photography, it's easy to take pictures and share them online with friends and family. However, what if you don't want to share your photos online for privacy reasons? You have a few options:

1. Don't take any pictures. This is probably not the best solution, especially if you enjoy photography.

2. Burn your photos to a disc or store them on an external hard drive. This is a great solution if you want to keep your photos but don't want to share them online. You can also give the disc or hard drive to friends and family as a gift.

3. Upload your photos to a private album on Facebook. This is a great option if you want to share your photos with friends and family but don't want everyone to be able to see them.

4. Use a photo storage site like Flickr or Picasa Web Albums. These sites allow you to store your photos privately or make them public, depending on your needs.
