#  Sending Chips in the Globe Series of Poker App Vwin: Tips and Tricks

♦ The best way to win in the Globe Series of Poker (GSOP) app is to send chips to opponents who are weak and have less than 1,000 chips. This will force them to fold, and you can take their chips.

♦ If you are in a hand with a player who has more than 1,000 chips, it is best to fold unless you have a very strong hand. 
Only try to bluff these players if you think they will fold easily.

♦ If there is a player in the hand who has fewer than 1,000 chips, make sure you do not give them too many chips. This way, you can take their chips when they fold.

♦ Another way to take someone's chips is to wait until they go all-in. If they lose the hand, you will get their entire chip stack.
