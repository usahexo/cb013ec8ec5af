#  Fruity Crown Is The Latest Online Casino To Be Shut Down By Authorities

Since the turn of the year, authorities in various parts of the world have been targeting online casinos. The latest in this string of closures is Fruity Crown, an operator that has been around for a few years.

The shutdown comes as part of a wider effort to crack down on illegal gambling operations. Officials in Curacao, where Fruity Crown is registered, took action after receiving complaints from player organizations.

This follows similar moves against other casinos in recent months. In December, for instance, Canadian authorities seized assets from popular site Swish Casino. And in January, police in Serbia shut down four sites including Golden Star Casino.

Why Are Operators Being Shut Down?

There are a number of reasons authorities are targeting online casinos. One is the sheer scale of the industry – it’s estimated that over $50 billion is wagered each year, most of which is done illegally.

This presents a major problem for regulators as they struggle to keep up with the ever-growing number of sites and games. It’s also difficult to track money flows and protect players from scams and cheating.

Another issue is tax evasion. Online casinos are often based offshore where there are lower tax rates. This allows operators to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes each year.

Finally, there’s a concern that online casinos can be used to launder money and finance criminal activities. This was one of the main reasons for the crackdown on Swish Casino late last year.

What Does This Mean For Players?

For players, the closure of Fruity Crown means that they can no longer access their account or play any games. It’s not clear if any funds are currently frozen or if players will be able to get their money back.

All other casinos that have been targeted recently remain open for now, but it’s unclear how long this will last. In most cases, players have been able to withdraw their funds without any problems. However, this may not be possible in all cases so it’s important to check with the casino first.

#  Gambling Is A Major Money Maker For Criminal Groups

Organized crime groups rely on gambling as a major money maker, according to research from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

In its report “The Globalization of Crime: A Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment”, UNODC said that while drugs remain the top money-making criminal activity, proceeds from gambling have been increasing in recent years.

The report noted that criminals are drawn to gambling because it is a low-risk and high-profit enterprise. It also said that illegal gambling is often linked to other criminal activities, such as money laundering and racketeering.

UNODC cited a series of high-profile cases in which organized crime groups had infiltrated the global gambling market. In one case, an Italian mafia syndicate was found to have control over illegal gambling operations in several European countries. In another case, a Chinese triad was discovered to be running an online gambling ring that raked in millions of dollars.

Gambling offences are punishable by law in many jurisdictions, but they are often difficult to detect and prosecute. This gives criminals a certain degree of impunity when it comes to this type of criminality.

Organized crime groups are increasingly turning to online gambling as a way to make money, given the difficulty of detecting and prosecuting such crimes. As a result, online casinos and sports betting websites are becoming increasingly vulnerable to exploitation by criminals.

The UNODC report called for greater cooperation among national governments and law enforcement agencies in order to combat the global threat posed by organized crime groups involved in gambling activities.

#  How Gambling Fuels Other Crimes

When someone gambles, they are taking a risk that can lead to a number of different outcomes. They may win money, lose money, or have their bet refunded. In some cases, people may also get caught up in illegal activities in order to get money to gamble with. This can lead to a number of other criminal activities, which can cause problems for both the individual and the community as a whole.

One of the most common ways that gambling can lead to other criminal activities is when people start stealing in order to get money to gamble with. This can include taking things from others, such as stealing money or goods, or committing fraud in order to get access to funds. Some people may even resort to selling drugs in order to make money that can be used for gambling purposes.

Gambling can also lead to violence in certain situations. When someone loses money while gambling, they may become angry and aggressive. This can lead to arguments and fights, which can sometimes turn violent. In addition, there have been cases where people have been killed over gambling debts.

Gambling can also have negative consequences for families. When someone becomes addicted to gambling, it can often lead to financial problems for the family as a whole. This can include draining the family's finances or even causing them to go into debt. Additionally, addiction to gambling can also lead to emotional problems within the family, such as anger and resentment.

Overall, gambling can be linked with a number of different criminal activities. It can often lead people down a path of ruin, both financially and emotionally. It is important for communities to be aware of these dangers and take steps to prevent gambling from happening in the first place.

#  Singaporeans Love Gambling, But It Comes At A Cost

Singapore is a country that is well-known for its gambling culture. In fact, many surveys have shown that Singaporeans are some of the most avid gamblers in the world. This love of gambling comes at a cost, however, as it has been linked to a number of social problems, such as bankruptcy and crime.

The problem with gambling is that it can be addictive. For some people, gambling becomes an addiction that they cannot control. This can lead to them spending money that they cannot afford, often resulting in bankruptcy. Gambling can also lead to criminal behaviour, as people may be tempted to steal in order to get money to gamble with.

Gambling can also have negative consequences for relationships. When someone becomes addicted to gambling, they may start to neglect their loved ones in favour of spending time at the casino or betting shop. This can lead to tension and conflict within the family.

Despite the many risks associated with gambling, it is still very popular in Singapore. This is likely because gambling can be so addictive and exciting. It can be fun to place a bet and see if you can win big bucks. However, it is important to remember that gambling comes with serious risks and should not be taken lightly.

#  Gambling: A Gateway Drug To More Serious Crime?

A recent study has found a worrying trend with gambling addicts; that they are more likely to commit serious crimes in order to fund their addiction.

The study, which was undertaken by the University of Liverpool, looked at data from over 5,000 gamblers who had sought help for their addiction. It found that those who had committed serious crimes while addicted to gambling were more than twice as likely to have also committed other serious crimes, such as violence or theft.

These findings suggest that gambling can be a gateway drug to more serious criminal activity, and highlights the need for better support services for those affected by gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. Those affected often feel powerless to stop their behaviour, and can feel ashamed and embarrassed about their addiction.

Support services for gambling addiction are available, but they are not always easy to find or access. There is a need for better education and awareness around gambling addiction, so that those affected can seek help before things spiral out of control.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help as soon as possible. The National Gambling Helpline is a free and confidential service that can provide advice and support.
