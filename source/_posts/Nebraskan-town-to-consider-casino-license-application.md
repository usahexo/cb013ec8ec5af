#  Nebraskan town to consider casino license application

Omaha, Nebraska is set to consider an application for a casino license next week. The proposed casino would be located in Carter Lake, Iowa and would be operated by the Santoro family.

The Santoro family has been involved in the casino industry for many years. They currently operate a casino in Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is just across the river from Omaha.

The proposed casino would include a hotel, restaurants, and of course, gambling tables and slot machines.

The Santoros believe that the casino would be a big boon to the local economy. They say that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue for the town of Carter Lake.

Not everyone is on board with the proposal, however. Some residents of Carter Lake are concerned about the potential negative impacts that the casino could have on their community.

I addition to concerns about crime and traffic congestion, some people are worried that the casino will attract problem gamblers who will wind up spending all their money at the casino instead of paying their bills or supporting their families.

Despite these concerns, the town council is expected to approve the casino license application next week.

#  Group seeks license for York County casino

A group of investors hoping to open a casino in York County has submitted an application for a gambling license.

The group, which calls itself the York County Gaming Association, is seeking a Category 3 license, which would allow it to operate up to 1,500 slot machines and 60 table games.

Association spokesman Joe Weinert said the group is made up of local businesspeople who want to bring jobs and economic development to the area.

"This is a great opportunity for York County," Weinert said. "We have the infrastructure in place, and we're already a tourist destination. A casino would only add to that."

York County officials are hopeful that the casino will be approved.

"We're excited about this opportunity," said county spokeswoman Barb Milligan. "A casino would be a great addition to our economy."

Opponents of the casino say it will only benefit the investors and not locals. They also express concerns about crime and gambling addiction.

#  Markham seeks casino license

The city of Markham, located in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, is seeking a casino license from the provincial government. The city council has voted unanimously in favor of seeking the license, which would allow them to build a casino resort complex.

If approved, the casino resort would be built on a 100-acre site near Highway 7 and Warden Avenue. It would include a hotel, casino, and convention center, as well as restaurants and retail space. The project is expected to cost $300 million and create 1,500 jobs.

Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti said that the casino resort would be a major tourism draw for the city. He added that it would also generate much-needed revenue for the city's coffers. "This is something we need in order to generate new revenues," he said.

The decision to seek a casino license comes as the provincial government is considering expanding gambling in Ontario. A report by former TD Bank CEO Ed Clark released last year recommended that the provincial government sell off its stake in Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) and use the money raised to pay down the province's debt.

The report also recommended that the province allow private companies to operate casinos in addition to OLG's current network of casinos. It remains to be seen whether the provincial government will adopt all of Clark's recommendations, but it seems likely that some form of gambling expansion will be approved in the near future.

Markham is not alone in seeking a casino license; several other municipalities are also interested in building resorts. However, Markham is considered a front runner due to its location close to Toronto and its willingness to build a resort complex rather than just a stand-alone casino.

#  Detroit group vying for second Detroit-area casino license

A group of businesspeople in Detroit are hoping to win the license for a second casino in the Detroit area. If they are successful, this would be a major win for the city, which is still recovering from bankruptcy.

The group, which is aptly named Detroit 2.0, has pledged to invest $1 billion in the project. They are hoping to build the casino in downtown Detroit, which would create thousands of jobs and bring in much-needed revenue for the city.

There is already one casino in the Detroit area, but it is located far from downtown and has not been as successful as hoped. A second casino in a more central location would be much more popular, and would help to revive Detroit’s economy.

The licensing process is still ongoing, so it is too early to say whether or not Detroit 2.0 will be successful. However, they have already demonstrated that they have the financial resources and necessary backing to make this project a reality.

Detroit has long been known as a major center of entertainment and culture. A second casino would only add to its appeal and could help to revitalize the city’s economy.

#  Feds reject Mohegan Sun's bid for casino license in Connecticut

Mohegan Sun's $ Connecticut casino license bid has been rejected by the Federal government. The rejection comes as a surprise, as the Mohegan Tribe had been lobbying hard for the past two years to get the new casino built.

The proposed casino would have been situated in East Windsor, just minutes away from the MGM Springfield Resort Casino, which is under construction and set to open in 2018. The Mohegan Sun argued that the new casino was needed to compete with MGM, but it seems that the Federal government didn't agree.

In a statement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs said that it "does not find that the proposed … East Windsor casino is necessary to protect tribal gaming interests in Connecticut."

This is a huge blow to the Mohegan Tribe, which has seen its revenues from gambling decline in recent years. The tribe had hoped that the new casino would help turn things around.

It's unclear what will happen now that the bid has been rejected. There is speculation that the tribe could try to build a smaller-scale casino, or even partner with another group to get the project off the ground.
