#  The Development of Poker in Kansas Spawned Numerous Tournaments and Leagues

Poker has a long and proud history in the state of Kansas. The game was first introduced there in the early 1800s, and it has been enjoyed by residents ever since. There are now numerous tournaments and leagues that are held throughout the state, and players from all over come to participate.

One of the earliest recorded mentions of poker in Kansas came in 1855. A man named J.B.SMITH wrote an article for The Lawrence Republican in which he described a game of five-card draw that he had played with some friends. The game was evidently popular, as SMITH noted that “poker is becoming quite a rage here”.

The popularity of poker continued to grow over the years, and by 1881 there were already several tournaments being held in the state. One such event was the “Kansas City Poker Tournament”, which drew players from all over. In 1898, the first official poker league was formed in Wichita. The Wichita Poker League (WPL) is still going strong today, and is one of the longest-running poker leagues in the country.

Over the years, many notable players have come out of Kansas. Doyle Brunson, Phil Ivey, and Annie Duke are just a few of the big names who got their start playing poker in Kansas. And while the state isn’t home to as many high-profile tournaments as places like Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it does have a loyal following of poker enthusiasts who love to play the game they love best.
