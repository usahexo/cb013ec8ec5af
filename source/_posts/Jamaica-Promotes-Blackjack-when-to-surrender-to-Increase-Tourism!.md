When vacationing in Jamaica, tourists are often looking for ways to let loose and have some fun. One great option is to try your luck playing blackjack at one of Jamaica's casinos. Here is what you need to know before you head to the tables.

Blackjack games in Jamaica use a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. You can hit (draw additional cards) or stand (end your turn). If you go over 21, you bust and lose the hand. The dealer also draws cards until they reach 17, and must stand on any total of 17 or higher.

The casino will pay out 3-to-2 on blackjacks (a hand consisting of an Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen or King). Other winning hands are paid out according to a standard payout schedule. In addition, if the dealer has a blackjack and you do not, the dealer wins automatically.

In order to participate in a blackjack game in Jamaica, you will need to place a bet. The minimum bet at most casinos is about USD $5, but it can vary depending on the table limits and number of decks being used. Casinos also offer different variations of the game, including surrender (allowing you to give up half your bet early in the hand if you think you are going to lose), double down ( doubling your bet after seeing your first two cards) and split (dividing a pair of cards into two separate hands).
