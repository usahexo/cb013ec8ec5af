#  How does Salsa Technology (Patagonia) work?

Salsa Technology is a water repellent and thermal regulating technology invented by the outdoor apparel company Patagonia. It has been featured in a number of their rain jackets and winter coats for the past few years.

The idea behind Salsa Technology is to create a water resistant barrier on the surface of the fabric that also regulates the temperature inside. This is done by trapping an insulating layer of air between the jacket’s outer fabric and inner lining. The trapped air helps to keep your body heat in, while at the same time repelling water and wind.

All of this comes together to create a jacket that is both warm and weather resistant. And unlike some other waterproof fabrics, Salsa Technology doesn’t make you sweat by preventing your body from cooling down naturally.

So if you’re looking for a good winter coat that will keep you warm and dry, check out some of Patagonia’s jackets with Salsa Technology.
