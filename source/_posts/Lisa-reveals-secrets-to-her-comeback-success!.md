#  Lisa's comeback: The untold story

When Lisa announced her comeback early in the year, the music industry was buzzing with expectation and excitement. 
After spending a few years out of the limelight, Lisa was back with a new album and a determined resolve to reclaim her throne as Queen of Pop.

However, things didn't quite go to plan. The album was met with mixed reviews, and sales were disappointing. With many questioning her ability to stay relevant in today's music scene, Lisa found herself fighting an uphill battle to win back her fans.

But then something amazing happened. Slowly but surely, people started listening to her music and appreciating it for what it is. Her concerts began selling out, and her latest single is topping the charts all over the world.

So what exactly happened? How did Lisa manage to turn things around and make a successful comeback?

To understand Lisa's story, we need to take a look back at her career up until this point. 

Lisa first came onto the scene in the late 90s as part of the girl group 3T. The group had moderate success with their debut album, but it was Lisa's solo work that really caught people's attention. 
Her 1998 self-titled album was a huge hit, spawning several hit singles including "Crazy in Love" and "That's How You Know". 
In 2001 she released her second album "Face Down", which achieved even greater success than her debut. It spawned several more hit singles including "Family Affair" and "Fallin'". 

By this point, Lisa was one of the biggest stars in the world and had amassed a huge following of fans. However, after releasing her third album in 2003 things started to go downhill. 
The album received mixed reviews from critics and failed to achieve the same level of success as her previous work. Additionally, Lisa began struggling with personal issues which led to a number of public breakdowns. 
As a result, she took a break from music and disappeared from the spotlight for several years. 

Now, after spending some time on hiatus rebuilding herself both mentally and musically, Lisa is back stronger than ever with a new album and a renewed determination to make it big once again. 

So how did she do it? How did she manage to turn things around and make a successful comeback? 
 well, there isn't one simple answer; it's been a combination of hard work, perseverance and luck that has led her here.  But if we take a closer look at some of the pivotal moments in her comeback journey we can get an idea of what might have helped her succeed. 

Firstly, let's take a look at that new album; "Unbreakable". Released in October 2016, it garnered mixed reviews from critics but still managed to debut at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart selling 196 thousand copies in its first week alone . This may not seem like much compared to some of her earlier work , but considering that this is her first album in over 10 years it's actually quite impressive . It also proves that there is still an audience for Lisa's music , even if they may not be as large as they once were . 

Secondly , let's take a look at those live performances . In January 2017 Lisa embarked on an international tour called The Unbreakable World Tour , which saw her perform in numerous countries across North America , Europe , Asia and Australia . The tour was very successful , with tickets selling out quicklyand many shows being praised by fans and critics alike . This goes to show that people are still interested in seeing Lisa perform live ,and that there is still demand for her music despite any negative sentiment that may exist online . 

Lastly , let's talk about that single ; "Masterpiece". Released in February 2017 , it quickly shot up the charts worldwide reaching number 1 on iTunes in over 45 countries .
