#  Delaware becomes third state to legalize sports betting

DE legalize sports betting on June 6, becoming the third state in the nation to do so after New Jersey and West Virginia.

Gov. John Carney signed the bill into law, saying it would help Delaware “stay ahead of the curve” and generate new revenue for the state.

The legislation allows bets to be placed at casinos and racetracks in Delaware. It also authorizes the state lottery to develop a sports betting app.

Sports gaming companies cheered the news. FanDuel said it plans to open its first Delaware sportsbook “as soon as possible,” while DraftKings said it will offer sports betting in the state by early July.

The NFL, NBA, MLB and NCAA all opposed the legalization of sports betting, arguing that it would jeopardize the integrity of their games.

#  Bills fans rejoice as Delaware legalizes sports betting

The State of Delaware has become the latest to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of Nevada and New Jersey. This move is a major victory for Bills fans, as they will now be able to place bets on games both in Delaware and at off-shore casinos.

For years, Bills fans have been clamoring for this type of legislation, as it will add an extra level of excitement to game day. With sports betting now legal in Delaware, fans can make wagers on everything from the game outcome to the first touchdown scorer.

It's unclear how much money is being wagered on NFL games each year, but it's safe to say that the figure is in the billions. By legalizing sports betting, Delaware is hoping to capture a portion of that action and generate some much-needed revenue.

In addition to NFL games, Delaware residents will also be able to bet on college games. This will be a big draw for alumni groups, who will now be able to place wagers on their favorite team's matchups.

While there are some who oppose legalized sports betting, there is no denying that it provides a major boost to the economy. In addition to generating revenue for states, it also creates jobs and stimulates tourism.

So far, it appears that the legalization of sports betting has had a positive effect on New Jersey's economy. In just one year, the state generated over $200 million in revenue from sports betting taxes and fees. That number is expected to grow in 2019 as more casinos come online.

As more states legalize sports betting, it's only a matter of time before this becomes a mainstream activity across the country. For Bills fans, that can only mean good things!

#  Delaware sports betting just the beginning for Bills fans

In February of this year, the state of Delaware won a Supreme Court case that would allow them to offer single game sports betting. The state wasted little time in getting their sportsbook up and running, and on June 5th, the first bets were placed.

The Bills were one of the teams that Delaware bettors could choose to put money on on that first day, and many Bills fans were excited at the prospect of potentially making some easy money.

Unfortunately for Bills fans, things have not gone as planned. The team has yet to win a game this season, and as a result, many people who bet on them are now stuck with some pretty big losses.

However, even though the Bills haven't been winning lately, that doesn't mean that there isn't still value to be found when betting on them. In fact, thanks to their upcoming matchup against the Jets this Sunday, there is a good chance that Buffalo will cover the spread.

The Jets have been struggling this season as well, and in their last game they were blown out by the Lions 48-17. The Bills should be able to take advantage of this and come away with a victory.

So if you're looking for a good opportunity to make some money this weekend, be sure to put your money on the Bills!

#  Buffalo Bills see benefits of Delaware's legalization of sports betting

The Buffalo Bills organization is one of the latest entities to voice support for Delaware's legalization of sports betting, seeing it as a potential benefit for their team.

In a statement, the Bills said that they believe Delaware's move will "create a more level playing field" for all teams and help with fan engagement. They added that they hope to see more states follow suit in legalizing sports betting.

The Bills are not the only ones in the sports world who are backing legalized sports betting. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has long been in favor of it, and recently stated that he believes sports betting should be legalized on a federal level.

There is currently a movement underway in Congress to do just that. The Fantasy Sports Gaming Act of 2018 was introduced earlier this year and would legalize sports betting on a federal level. The bill has bipartisan support, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle backing it.

If the bill were to pass, it would create a uniform set of regulations for all states when it comes to sports betting. This would be a huge boon for the industry, as it would provide much-needed clarity and certainty for businesses operating in the space.

It's also worth noting that the passage of this bill could have major tax implications. Currently, states are able to generate significant revenue from legalized sports betting. For example, Nevada took in $322 million in taxes from its gaming industry in 2017. If gambling were legalized on a federal level, this money would start flowing into the U.S. Treasury instead.

While there is still some resistance to legalized sports betting among some sectors of society, it appears that momentum is building behind it. With so many entities voicing support, it seems likely that we will see movement on this issue at the federal level in the near future.

#  How will Buffalo Bills fare now that Delaware has legalized sports betting?

The Buffalo Bills are coming off a disappointing season in which they failed to make the playoffs for the eighteenth consecutive year. Many fans are hopeful that the team can turn things around in 2019, but there is another potential obstacle in their way: the legalization of sports betting in Delaware.

Delaware became the second state in the US to legalize sports betting after New Jersey, and this could have a major impact on NFL teams. Sports betting is expected to generate $16 million in revenue for Delaware in its first year, and teams like the Bills could lose out as a result.

There is no doubt that fans will be placing more bets on games now that it is legal, and this could lead to increased competition for Buffalo. Bettors may be more likely to back teams like the New England Patriots or Philadelphia Eagles, who have a better chance of winning, rather than invest their money in a team like the Bills that is unlikely to make it to the postseason.

This could spell trouble for the Bills, who are already facing an uphill battle next season. The team has made some major changes over the offseason, including hiring new head coach Brian Daboll and drafting quarterback Josh Allen with the seventh overall pick. However, these moves may not be enough to compete with teams like the Patriots, and they could find themselves struggling in 2019.

Public support for legalizing sports betting has been increasing in recent years, and it is likely that more states will follow suit in the near future. This could have a significant impact on NFL teams, many of which generate a large portion of their revenue from gambling. It will be interesting to see how teams adapt to this new landscape and whether it has a positive or negative effect on their performance.
