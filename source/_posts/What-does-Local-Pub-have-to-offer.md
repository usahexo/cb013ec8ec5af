#  What games are available in Local Pub?

A Pub, or public house, is a drinking establishment found in many parts of the world. In the United Kingdom a pub is a small, independent business. A bar is a pub which serves alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises.

Cuisine range differs from traditional British food to international dishes. They may also offer gaming facilities such as pool, darts, and arcade games. In some cases live music and comedy are featured.

There are several types of pubs. These include the two-roomed traditional London gin palace with its prominent front window; Victorian-era tied houses, popular with sports fans; gastropubs; and theme pubs serving a specific type of food or drink.

Independent British brewers own around 60% of the country's 4,500 pubs, with regional brewers owning another 20%. The rest are owned by large pub chains such as Punch Taverns, Enterprise Inns, and Wetherspoons. 

Concerns have been raised about pub closures. Between 2000 and 2007 almost 2,000 British pubs closed – around one in six. This has been attributed to high taxes, property developers who convert pubs into apartments, and cheap alcohol available in supermarkets. Britons now drink more than half their beer outside of pubs. In 2013 there were 53,000 pubs in Britain – nearly 10,000 fewer than there were in 1982 when records began.

#  How can I play Local Pub slots?

If you're looking to play some local pub slots, there are a few things you need to know. The first is that not all pubs offer this game - you'll likely have the best luck at larger establishments. Second, the machines themselves vary in terms of what's available. Some may have just one or two games, while others will have several options to choose from. Finally, the biggest key to playing pub slots is knowing when to walk away. Like any casino game, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement and keep betting more and more - but before you know it, you've lost your money. So be sure to set yourself a limit and stick to it!
